                <div class="lead">The origin of the meaning of the word library has been traced to the Latin word “liber” meaning “books”. On the basis of the Latin interpretation, early professionals saw the library as a place where important records of human ideas were organized, processed and disseminated to users for the purposes of posterity and preservation from human and non-human damages. Subsequent library and information science scholars defined or explained the concept of the library based on the prevailing experience at the time such definition emerged.&nbsp;<div>The Glossary of Library Terms defines the library as a collection of books and other literary materials kept for reading, study and consultation. Furthermore, the library can be a building, a room or rooms containing a collection of books for use of the public, a portion of the public, members of a society, a public institution or an establishment charged with the responsibility to consult such books. According to Awolola and Jatto (2003), the library is a collection of information materials such as books, films, magazines, maps, manuscript, phonograph records etc. for use. Some people see it as a collection of books, serials and non-book materials kept for the purpose of reading and consultation. The library is further regarded as a collection of books and other literary materials property arranged in a building or rooms for the promotion of human knowledge. Nnaji (1986) defined library as a collection of books and other forms of records housed, organized and interpreted to meet broad and various needs of the people for information, knowledge, recreation and aesthetic enjoyments. The various definitions in this paragraph perceive the library as containing information-bearing materials in different formats and manner of communication and these materials can be collected and put together in a place for purpose other than just to use them where they are kept.</div><div>Social Role of the Library</div><div><br><p>.</p></div></div>
