                <div class="lead"><p><strong>Library as a Resource/Information Centre&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><span style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.07rem; color: rgb(35, 35, 35); line-height: 1.5;">the library serves as a resource Centre for all its users. It provides book and non-book materials that can assist users to learn, prepare for examinations, write project or engage in research work. In this respect, library user should be able to go into the library and find the necessary tools required to assist them in the search for knowledge. As an information Centre, the library provides opportunities whereby its users will be able to access information without any stress. In this case, the library must be adequately equipped with information-bearing research on diverse fields of human knowledge, particularly, the materials that fall within the scope of the setting in which the library is located.</span><br></p><p>&nbsp;Library as a Storehouse of Information</p><p>The library is a storehouse of information when it is stocked with a collection of written, printed, graphic and visual materials that are organized for the use of the clientele. Materials are usually arranged in the library according to a standard form so that users can find it easy to retrieve information from the items. As a physical plant dedicated to the storage of information materials, the library assumes the role of a workshop where people can seek information and acquire knowledge. In doing so, the library will be helping to share or transmit other peopleâ€™s experiences by reading through their thoughts which are contained either in book or non-book form.</p><p>&nbsp;Library as a house of collections</p><p>The responsibility of the library is to develop its collection of varied materials found in the reference, reserve, open shelves, audio-visual serials and documents sections. These collections, which have been carefully selected to meet the peculiar needs of users, however, differ from one library types to the other. This is because libraries are set up to serve different set of people either in an academic environment, in the research setting, in the public, school or special contexts. The collection in each of the groups must be relevant to the needs of the users</p><p>Objective of the library</p><p>The main objective of any library is to disseminate information. However, specific objective of the library vary from one type to the other. These may be&nbsp;</p><p>(a)	To enrich curriculum.</p><p>(b)	To promote the development of reading skills.</p><p>(c)	To support teaching/learning within the school system.</p><p>(d) 	To encourage research and independent study among student and teachers.</p><p>(e)	To cultivate a reading habit at early stage of learning among pupil and student.</p><p>Basic elements of the Library</p><p>According to Fola-Adio et al (2009), a library requires certain elements to be considered so. These include accommodation, organization, personnel, collection development system, users, rules and regulations.</p><p>(1)	Accommodation or Space: A space must be reserved for no other purpose than a library. The space provided must be conducive for carrying library routines and services. The space provided must not be a vacuum; there must be library materials such as books, tables, chairs, computer etc. to occupy the space.</p><p>(2)	Organization of Materials: The information materials in the library must be properly organized. In essence, they must be catalogued i.e. described pointing out bibliographic information such as author, tittle, edition, place and year of publication etc. They must also be classified i.e. assigned to appropriate subject group(s) and arranged on shelves for easy accessibility and retrieve in a particular order of location.</p><p>.</p></div>
